###*DO NOT COPY CODE.*
*Please, please, please, work on the challenges on your own before even looking at the source code in this repository. I'm putting up my code to serve as review material and as reference for the aspects of the language we've learned so far - not as a source code free-for-all.*


The code in this repository is intended as a REFERENCE only. If you haven't completed an assignment, don't look here unless you're absolutely stuck. You may find that toughing a problem out and trying different approaches will be much more beneficial than taking the shortcut.

At the same time, the code in this repository is by no means the best approach to a given problem.
